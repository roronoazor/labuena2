                                    <p>I have always wished to be an Entrepreneur even before joining the bank where I worked for close to a decade. I have failed in several ventures, so when I joined the bank, I started aiming at attaining the highest rank possible within a given period of time. </p>
                                    <p>For close to a decade I was still on the same level but I never stopped searching for a way out. I was later told that my service was no longer needed in 2018, so I continued my search for greatness. I met with my former superior colleague Mrs. Celine Nwosu online and she invited me to see this great opportunity. I came in as a secretary because I was so extremely broke and homeless. In less than a year everything changed to the glory of God. </p>
                                    <p>Now I'm not only making money, I have been able to mentor a lot of people who are also doing tremendously well financially. In less than a year I qualified for an all expense trip to Philippines in Asia. I'm not where I want to be yet but I’m fast approaching.</p>

                                    <p>Prior to seeing this opportunity, I had invested my savings from my salary in many investment vehicles and lost everything. At the point of seeing this opportunity, I was very skeptical and also broke. </p>
                                    <p>However, I gave it a go, borrowed some money and started. It turned out to be the best decision I made in 2018. Three months into this opportunity I resigned from medical practice to face the business fulltime. That too turned out to be a great decision. </p>
                                    <p>Looking back one year and seven months down the line, I am very delighted to have seen this opportunity that pays me daily and has helped me to build a team of partners who are committed to this business and whose lives have been transformed tremendously.</p>

But all these seemed a distant reality after graduation and working so hard for years in a job where I was only paid peanuts. </p>

                                    <p>Few years ago I was struggling financially. I got a Federal job at National Orientation Agency (N.O.A) in Ebonyi State Directorate.</p>

But after 11years with a salary of less than N100,000 per month, I found myself in debt, miserable, with no savings to fall back on which was my biggest fear. Amidst my financial crisis, a friend brought me the good news of the LA BUENA VIDA PROJECT.</p>
                                    <p>Fast forward today, the LA BUENA VIDA PROJECT has lived up to its name. I am now a Millionaire Circle Member earning multiple 7-digits and travelled on exotic vacations to Asia, East Africa and the Middle East.

                                    <p>I have also mentored so many people who are earning multiple 5-6 digits per month in over seven states across the country.</p>
                                    <p>Looking back today, I am so proud I wasn't foolish to walk away from this opportunity. </p>

                                    <p>After building an increasingly demanding 10-year career in infrastructure engineering, with some of the largest tech firms in Nigeria, he realised that if he ever wanted to spend good, memorable time with his wife and young kids, he had to find a way to transition out of his 60 hours a week routine.</p>
                                    <p>His most difficult question had always been "which business would pay me as much income as my salary in a short while and where will I find the time to even build such a business?"</p>
                                    <p>Within 2 years of partnering with our organisation (part-time) through the help and mentorship of some of the organisation's most experienced consultants, he was able to quit his time-consuming job. At the time, his earning from his part-time business was almost double his monthly salary.</p>
                                    <p>He is now a Millionaire Circle member and also has qualified to travel to several all-expense paid destinations with our organisation.</p>

When I got the hint that Lagos would be launched in September 2019, I fired my boss immediately regardless of all the entreaties. Lagos kicked off on September 20, 2019.</p>
                                    <p>To my utmost surprise, within 3 weeks of starting this business, I qualified to travel with the organization to two different countries, Ethiopia and Dubai for a vacation. </p>
